Adrian’s talented personality has allowed him in a record time during his period with me (1 year only) to catch up and become an expert in a variety of technologies (from iOS AR passing through Angular and Canvas Game Development and finishing in Android app development). His enthusiasm is of such level that in a few months he was able to transform many projects into reality, his intense work culture allowed him to successfully achieve numerous number of awards in all kind of hackathons and technological competitions. Any team will be lucky to have him by their side, and I am sure he will succeed in the future.",

Se incorporó al centro un año más tarde que sus compañeros y se tomó como un reto alcanzar el gran nivel que había en el aula. Al final el curso, no sólo consiguió las competencias básicas, sino que las ha superado. En concreto, estoy muy orgulloso de sus logros en Programación y hay que destacar que ganó la fase regional de Madrid de Programame.",
